# Public Health Surveillance Specialization - Project Summary

**Date Completed:** October 23, 2025
**Repository:** https://github.com/BryanTegomoh/nanochat
**Status:** ✅ Complete and Ready for Training

---

## What Was Accomplished

I created a **complete end-to-end pipeline** to specialize nanochat for public health surveillance applications. The system is designed for epidemiologists and public health officials to get AI assistance with disease outbreak detection, risk assessment, surveillance reporting, and more.

---

## 📦 What Was Created

### 1. **Synthetic Dataset Generation** (5,000 Examples)

**File:** `scripts/generate_surveillance_dataset.py`

Created a high-quality synthetic dataset covering 10 surveillance categories:

| Category | Examples | Description |
|----------|----------|-------------|
| Outbreak Detection | 750 | Identifying when cases exceed baselines |
| Trend Analysis | 750 | Analyzing epidemiological patterns |
| Risk Assessment | 750 | Evaluating population health threats |
| Surveillance Reports | 500 | Creating professional reports |
| Vaccination Coverage | 500 | Monitoring immunization programs |
| Data Interpretation | 500 | Explaining metrics (R₀, incidence rates) |
| Syndromic Surveillance | 500 | Early detection systems |
| Contact Tracing | 250 | Disease contact tracing protocols |
| Zoonotic Surveillance | 250 | Animal-human disease monitoring |
| Global Surveillance | 250 | International outbreak coordination |

**Dataset Quality:**
- Evidence-based epidemiological practices
- Structured professional responses (headers, bullets, recommendations)
- Actionable guidance for public health practitioners
- Diverse scenarios (diseases, regions, populations)

**Output:** `data/surveillance/` (train.json, validation.json, test.json)

---

### 2. **Custom Task Loader**

**File:** `tasks/surveillance.py`

- Loads surveillance data for training
- Implements evaluation methods
- Supports category-specific filtering
- Compatible with nanochat's Task system

---

### 3. **Training Pipeline**

**File:** `scripts/surveillance_sft.py`

Specialized training script with:

**Optimized Hyperparameters:**
- Conservative learning rates (25% lower for medical safety)
- 2 epochs for specialized dataset
- Frequent evaluation (every 50 steps)
- Validates general knowledge retention (MMLU/ARC)

**Data Mixture:**
- 4,000 surveillance examples (specialization)
- 2,000 general conversation examples (versatility)
- Total: ~6,000 training examples

**Output:** `surveillance_checkpoints/d26-surveillance/`

---

### 4. **Comprehensive Evaluation**

**File:** `scripts/surveillance_eval.py`

Multiple evaluation metrics:
- **ROUGE-1/2:** Text similarity to reference answers

- Note: Community model is general chat, not surveillance-specialized

---

### 9. **Git Configuration**

- Added `.claude/` to `.gitignore` (prevents IDE settings from being tracked)
- All surveillance files committed and pushed to GitHub
- Clean repository structure

significantly exceeds the baseline. Immediate investigation warranted to:
1. Confirm cases through laboratory testing
2. Identify source of infection
3. Implement control measures..."
```

### 2. Risk Assessment
```
Input: "Assess measles risk with 5% vaccination coverage in 1M population"

Output: "Overall Risk Level: HIGH
- Susceptible: 950,000 people (95%)
- Below herd immunity threshold (~95%)
- Recommendations:
  1. Urgent vaccination campaign
  2. Enhanced surveillance..."
```

### 3. Data Interpretation
```
Input: "What does R₀ = 3.5 mean?"

Output: "R₀ = 3.5 indicates each infected person causes ~3.5 secondary
infections. Herd immunity threshold: ~71%. Control measures must reduce
transmission by >71% to stop epidemic growth..."
