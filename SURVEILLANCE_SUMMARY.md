## ⚙️ Training Configuration

### Hyperparameters (Optimized for Medical Domain)

```python
# Conservative learning rates (vs. general chat)
embedding_lr = 0.15      # (default: 0.2) - 25% lower
matrix_lr = 0.015        # (default: 0.02) - 25% lower
unembedding_lr = 0.003   # (default: 0.004) - 25% lower

# More epochs for specialized dataset
num_epochs = 2           # (default: 1) - 2x more

# Frequent evaluation
eval_every = 50          # (default: 100) - 2x more frequent
eval_metrics_every = 200 # MMLU/ARC checks
```

**Rationale:**
- Lower learning rates prevent catastrophic forgetting
- More epochs ensure thorough learning of specialized domain
- Frequent evaluation catches overfitting early

### Training Data Mix

```python
train_ds = TaskMixture([
    PublicHealthSurveillance(split="train"),  # ~4,000 surveillance examples
    SmolTalk(split="train", stop=2_000),      # 2,000 general conversation
])
# Total: ~6,000 training examples
```

**Why mix data?**
- Surveillance data provides specialization
- General conversation maintains versatility
- Prevents overfitting to surveillance-only patterns

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### Using Your Own Data

**Step 1:** Format your data
```json
[
  {
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Your question"},
      {"role": "assistant", "content": "Expert answer"}
    ],
    "metadata": {"category": "outbreak_detection"}
  }
]
```

**Step 2:** Save to files
```
data/surveillance/train.json
data/surveillance/validation.json
data/surveillance/test.json
```

**Step 3:** Train as normal
```bash
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.surveillance_sft
```

### Adjusting Dataset Size

Edit `scripts/generate_surveillance_dataset.py`:
```python
train_data, val_data, test_data = generate_dataset(
    num_examples=10_000,  # Change from 5,000 to 10,000
    train_split=0.8,
    val_split=0.1
)
```

Regenerate:
```bash
python -m scripts.generate_surveillance_dataset
```

### Adding New Categories

**Step 1:** Create generator function in `generate_surveillance_dataset.py`:
```python
def generate_antimicrobial_resistance():
    """Generate AMR surveillance questions"""
    disease = random.choice(["MRSA", "VRE", "CRE", "MDR-TB"])
    templates = [...]
    return random.choice(templates)
```

**Step 2:** Add to generator list:
```python
generators = [
    # ... existing ...
    (generate_antimicrobial_resistance, 0.05),  # 5% of dataset
]
```

### Training Different Model Sizes

```bash
# Smaller model (faster, cheaper)
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.surveillance_sft --model_tag d20

# Larger model (more capable)
torchrun --standalone --nproc_per_node=8 -m scripts.surveillance_sft --model_tag d32
```

## ⚠️ Safety & Ethical Considerations

### Data Privacy (CRITICAL)
- ❌ **NEVER** train on identifiable patient data
- ✅ Use only de-identified, synthetic, or public data
- ✅ Implement data use agreements for institutional data
- ✅ Follow HIPAA/GDPR regulations

### Clinical Validity
- ✅ All training data reflects evidence-based practices
- ✅ Review outputs with epidemiologists
- ✅ Validate against CDC/WHO guidelines
- ✅ Regular quality audits

### Deployment Disclaimers
**Always include:**
```
This system provides decision support for public health professionals.
Not a replacement for professional judgment or official protocols.
Verify with official sources (CDC, WHO, local health departments).
Consult senior epidemiologists for critical decisions.
```

### Bias & Equity
- Test performance across diverse populations
- Ensure training data includes underrepresented diseases
- Monitor for geographic or demographic biases
- Address health equity in recommendations

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| **Out of memory during training** | Reduce `device_batch_size` to 2 or 1 |
| **Model not loading** | Check checkpoint exists in `surveillance_checkpoints/` |
| **Poor evaluation scores** | Train longer, reduce learning rates, or increase data |
| **Lost general knowledge** | Increase SmolTalk proportion from 2,000 to 5,000 |
| **Dataset not found** | Run `python -m scripts.generate_surveillance_dataset` |

### Validation Checks

**Before Training:**
```bash
# Verify setup
python -m scripts.test_surveillance_setup

# Check dataset
python -c "import json; print(len(json.load(open('data/surveillance/train.json'))))"
```

**During Training:**
- Monitor validation loss (should decrease)
- Check MMLU/ARC scores (should stay > 0.5)
- Watch for NaN losses (if occurs, reduce learning rates)

**After Training:**
- Run full evaluation
- Review sample outputs manually
- Test with real-world queries
